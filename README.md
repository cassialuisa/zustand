# Zustand Counter App

#### With the aim of improving knowledge about state management for React applications, this repo was created to save this content and be a kind of base to be used in the future if I choose to have zustand in the development of future applications.

## Why Zustand? 

#### Zustand can be defined as a global state management library, having practically the same function that is proposed by other libraries such as Redux, or react's own ContextAPI through the UseContext hook. Zustand, in turn, stands out for the absence of the need to wrap the application in a Provider and declare the state itself in a component as is done with ContextAPI and other solutions, causing possible performance problems in the future.
